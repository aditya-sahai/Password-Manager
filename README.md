### How It Works:
The program first asks the user for the admin password. If the user enter the correct password then the user gets 4 options:
1)  Write New Password
2)  Update Password
3)  Remove Password
4)  Get Password

The user then enters the requirement number then the program asks the user for the website/app of password. If the user enter Write New Password or Update Password the program also asks the user for the password. Then on the basis of the user's requirement the program gets/adds the required data from/to the json file in which all the websites/apps and the passwords are encrypted. Then the program simply displays a message or the required data.!
